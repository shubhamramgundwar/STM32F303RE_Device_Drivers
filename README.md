# STM32F303RE_Device_Drivers
A comprehensive collection of low-level device drivers developed for STM32Fx series microcontrollers. This repository provides efficient, lightweight, and modular C code implementations that interact directly with STM32 hardware peripheralsâ€”perfect for building embedded applications from scratch without relying on HAL or other abstraction layers.
